    <p2 style="text-align:center">At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough
        fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have
        shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart</p>
    <h2 style="color:orange" >INGREDIENTS</h2><i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <ul>
        <li>Tea Bag</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional)</li>
        <li>Sugar/Honey (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:orange">PREPARATION</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only 
            boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!</li>
        <li>Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)</li>
        <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
        <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 
            minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</li>
        <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon 
            against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.</li>
        <li>If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
